# XenHide
XenHide is a Python-based steganography toolkit for embedding and extracting hidden data within digital media. It provides both command-line scripts and a lightweight graphical interface, inspired by tools such as `steghide` and `zsteg`.
XenHide runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of concealing information within a non-secret carrier medium such that the existence of the hidden data is not apparent to an observer. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography makes data invisible.
In the digital world, common techniques include:
- Hiding text inside the least significant bits (LSB) of an image's pixels
- Embedding data inside audio waveforms without perceptible distortion
- Concealing information within metadata or file structure patterns
XenHide currently focuses on image-based steganography using the LSB technique.
## Building
XenHide is a Python project with minimal dependencies. A virtual environment is recommended.
### Requirements
| Platform      | Dependencies              |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Linux         | Python 3.13+, stegano       |
| Windows       | Python 3.13+, stegano       |
| macOS         | Python 3.13+, stegano       |
| GUI (all)     | PyQt5 (optional)          |
Developed and tested on Python 3.13.
## Install
Download the latest version from the [XenHide Releases](https://github.com/metrinaveen08/XenHide/releases)

**Mobile users:** the Android app is available as a prebuilt APK — grab `xh_mobile.apk` directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/metrinaveen08/XenHide/releases) and sideload it (no build steps required).
